            Hello all! Welcome to my first html webpage! My name is Lawrence Ng
            and I have just started learning HTML and CSS coding. I am exited
            to show you my progress so far. Hopefully this 
            site will show up fine for you!
        </p> 
        <p>
            Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I lived in Hong Kong
            until I was 10 years old, then I moved to San Francisco.
            As far as hometown goes, I consider both places
            to be pretty influential to my upbringing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went to college at University of California, Irvine. I studied 
            mechanical and aerospace engineering. Currently, I am working
            as a Service Engineer at Santa Clara-based Indicate Technologies Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            My biggest hope for this class is to acquire more programming and web
            development skills that will hopefully land me new opportunities and
            career paths.  
        </p>
